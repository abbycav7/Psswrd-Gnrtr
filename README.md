# Challenge-3-Password-Generator

## Description 

This week I was challenged with creating a password generator.

When I first began adding to JavaScript, I found that google was my friend. I was able to find videos explaining for loops and even some online practice which was very helpful. I have enjoyed this lesson more than our last two because I enjoy the logic that comes with JavaScript. I am excited to learn and try more.

Overall this was a fun project, even though challenging at most times, I found it interesting and enjoyed myself making this password generator.
